# My Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio!

Visit my webpage if you want to get to know me, checkout my projects and get in touch. Projects included on this page is a part of a two year Higher Professional Degree in frontend development at Noroff.

I've tried something new and un-tradisional regarding the design and tried to challenge myself with styling refresh my styling skills using SCSS. Hope you find it interesting, I might just use a framework when I re-design in later stage.
